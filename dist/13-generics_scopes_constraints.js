// Generics Scopes & Constraints
// We're going to discuss how scoping works with type params, and how we can
//  describe type params that have more specific requirements than `any`.
// Generic Constraints
//  Allow us to describe the "minimum requirement" for a type param, such that
//  we can achieve a high degree of flexibility, while still being able to
//  safely assume some minimal structure and behavior.
// Motivating Use Case - Recall the example we used in our Generic's Chapter:
function listToDict4(list, // array as input
idGen // obtain item id
) {
    // Create dictionary to fill
    const dict = {};
    for (let item of list) {
        const id = idGen(item);
        dict[id] = item;
    }
    return dict;
}
// Letâ€™s strip away some noise and just study the function signature:
function lToDict(list, idGen) {
    return {};
}
function listToDict5(list) {
    const dict = {};
    list.forEach(item => {
        dict[item.id] = item;
    });
    return dict;
}
// Great, now let's implement this with generics
function listToDictGeneric(list) {
    const dict = {};
    list.forEach(item => {
        // dict[item.id] = item; // Error: Property 'id' does not exist on type 'Type'
    });
    return dict;
}
// The problem here is that `Type` can be ANYTHING, potentially without an `id`
//  We were able to get away with this in our initial solution (with the idGen
//  function) because `listToDict` didn't really do anything with the `Type`
//  other than store a reference to it in the dictionary.
// Describing the Constraint
// The way we define constraints on generics is by using the `extends` keyword
// The correct way of making our function generic is shown in the following:
// Note that our 'requirement' for our argument type(`HasId`) is now represented
//  in two places:
//  1. extends HasId as the constraint on Type
//  2. `list: Type[]` as the argument type to ensure we get an array
function listToDictGeneric2(list) {
    const dict = {};
    list.forEach(item => {
        dict[item.id] = item;
    });
    return dict;
}
;
// Type Extends vs. Class Extends
// The `extends` keyword is used in object-oriented inheritance, and while
//  not strictly equivalent to how it is used in type params, it is similar.
// When a class extends from a base class, it's guaranteed to at least align
//  with the base class structure.  In the same way, Type extends HasId 
//  guarantees that "Type is at least a HasId".
// Scopes and TypeParams
// When working with function parameters, we know that "inner scopes" have the
//  ability to access "outer scopes", but not vice versa.  This is true for
//  type params as well.
// function receiveFruitBasket(bowl: string) {
//   console.log('Thanks for the fruit basket!');
//   // only bowl can be accessed here
//   return (bowl, (apple) => {
//     // bowl and apple can be accessed here
//   })
// }
function tupleCreator(first) {
    // only first can be accessed here
    return function finish(last) {
        // both first and last can be accessed here
        return [first, last];
    };
}
const finishTuple = tupleCreator(3);
const t1 = finishTuple(null);
const t2 = finishTuple([4, 5, 6]);
// The same design principles that you use for deciding whether values belong as
//  class fields vs arguments passed to members should serve well here
// Remember, this is not exactly an independent decision to make, as the
//  types belong to the same scope as the values they represent.
// Best Practices
// 1. Use each type parameter at least twice.  Any less and you might be casting
//     with the as keyword.  Let's take a look at an example.
function returnAs(arg) {
    return arg; // an 'any that will seem like a Type
}
const firstly = returnAs(window);
const secondly = window;
// 2. Define type params as simply as possible.  Consider these two:
function ex1(list) {
    list[0].id;
    return list.pop();
}
function ex2(list) {
    return list[0].id;
}
